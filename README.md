# front-end testing
This package is designed to practice various automated testing techniques. Test environments and test sites are usually quite simple; they often don't reflect the challenges and complexities testers face in real projects. That's why I decided to use a real commercial site for my tests â€” the marketplace 999.md.

In my project, I use various models, frameworks, and tools, such as POM, Selenium, TestNG, and more.
